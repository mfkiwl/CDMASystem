% Receiver: Performs data processing operations like SIC,
%           channel decoding, qam demodulation, etc at the receiver end.
% Input: rxDataStreamMat, txParams
%        rxDataStreamMat - A qam modulated data stream containing information
%                          of multiple users
%        txParams        - A structure containing system parameters like
%                          number of users, code rate, qam alphabet etc.
%
% Output: data -          A matrix containing information of multiple user
%                         where each user is assigned one column.
